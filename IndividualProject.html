        <p style="text-align:center;">- Catherine Stuart</p>
        <p><i> I would highly recommend Lindsey to all our friends and family, she takes pride in her work and
        puts the customer first. Spends endless amount of hours trying to get the best bang for your buck and is extremely patient.
        the amount of knowledge and connections she has made in the industry, streamlines your investment and her commitment.
            My house was sold over the asking listing in less than two weeks! Our experience was excellent from start to finish,
        thanks to lindsey. I would definitely reach out again to sell any property. </i></p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">- Jasmine Ahmedi</p>
        <p><i>At first I thought the experience would be daunting, but with the help of lindsey, she was able to reach all
        our needs. She is an outstanding negotiator, listens carefully and a has breath of knowledge in the industry.
        My husband and I listed 3 properties to sell, while one sold less than a week, the others took a couples months.
        In that time Lindsey and her drive to sell the house was not affected, she was very eager and driven to accomplish
        what she has promised. I will absolutely recommend Lindsey to my friends and family and any of my future listings!</i></p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">- Brooks Foster</p>
        <p><i> With the dream of my husband and I, owning a beautiful larger style apartment by the water I thought it
            would be next to impossible at today's market rate. Lindsey was able to find us an open concept condo with
            all the amenities we were looking for, well within our budget. I could not have thanked Lindsey and her team enough
            for all the hard work and endless days of searching for our dream home.</i></p>
